Welcome to the greatest intellectual challenge of all time: Tic-Tac-Toe.  
This will be a showdown between your human brain and my silicon processor.  

You will make your move known by entering a number, 0 - 8.  The number 
will correspond to the board position as illustrated:

								0 | 1 | 2
								---------
								3 | 4 | 5
								---------
								6 | 7 | 8

Prepare yourself, human.  The ultimate battle is about to begin. \n
